Yes, ansible is mainly used for OPS department, but actually in my tester daily work,it plays a great role
for automating environment relative operations. 
DIY is not only a goal for developer, but also for everyone want to make a easier life. 
Want to be DIY is not assets but your libility.
So make your wills into codes, make your codes to your assets.

This Repo is my daily ansible scripts. Hope it works for different companies. And Hope this also could make me looks like a great ops/dev guy but not a tester only clicking all around, actually I like to click or tap all round, it is definitely more fun than inputing all kinds of unix/shell commands, and some trick codes.

Enjoy it!
