# DH-Runscripts

Yes,writing scripts like ansible,shell is what dev or ops guys' daily activities,but actually in my tester daily work,it plays a great role for automating environment relative operations. 

DRY(don't repeate yourself) is not only valid for developer or ops, but also for everyone want to make a easier life(to be honest, before you want to make your life easier by DRY, you gonna suffer for a little bit while, I call it assets accumulation).

Want to be DRY is not assets but your libility.
So turn your wills into codes, running the codes everyday, then it is really your assets. 

This Repo is my daily scripts maybe includes ansible,python,shell ...... 

Hope they could work for different companies, and also could make me looking like a ops/dev guy but not a tester only clicking around(just joking, because tester is underdog who make hustle play, so I wanna pretend I am not a tester). 

Actually I like to click or tap round, it is definitely more fun than inputing all kinds of unix/shell commands, some trick codes, and saying some big/buzz words which no one knows.

Make your daily codes reusable, that's all I want.
Obviously,there must be bad codes everywhere, so enjoy it just like a tester.
